To deploy a web app on Vercel using GitHub integration, you'll need to have a few things ready:

1.  Your web app code. This should be in a Git repository on GitHub and ready to be pushed to a remote server.
2.  A Vercel account. You can sign up for a free account on the Vercel website.
3.  The Vercel GitHub integration enabled for your repository. This will allow Vercel to automatically deploy your web app whenever you push code to your GitHub repository.

Once you have these things ready, you can follow these steps to deploy your web app on Vercel using GitHub integration:

1.  Log in to your Vercel account and go to the Integrations tab in your settings.
2.  Click the "Add Integration" button and select "GitHub" from the list of available integrations.
3.  Follow the prompts to authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account and repositories.
4.  Select the repository that contains your web app code, and choose the branch that you want to deploy.
5.  Click the "Save" button to save your integration settings.

From now on, whenever you push code to the selected branch of your repository, Vercel will automatically deploy your web app. You can view and manage your deployments in the Vercel dashboard, as well as see metrics and performance data for your web app.

In summary, using the Vercel GitHub integration is a quick and easy way to deploy your web app on Vercel. By linking your GitHub repository to Vercel, you can automatically trigger deployments whenever you push code, so you can focus on building and improving your app without worrying about deployment.
