As a full-stack developer, I am always on the lookout for the best tools and technologies to use in my projects. Over the years, I have experimented with various JavaScript stacks and have finally settled on a combination that works exceptionally well for me: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, TRPC, NextAuth.js, and Prisma.

# Next.js (typescript)

Starting with the frontend, Next.js is a framework for building server-rendered React applications. It provides a powerful set of features such as automatic code splitting, optimized performance, and easy deployment. I particularly love the seamless integration with TypeScript, which is a typed superset of JavaScript that helps me catch errors early on and write more maintainable code.

# Tailwind css

For styling, I use Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows me to rapidly build custom designs without the bloat of a traditional framework. It comes with a wide range of pre-designed classes that can be easily composed to create any layout or design. I find it particularly useful for prototyping and quickly iterating on design ideas.

# TRPC

On the backend, I use TRPC for communication between my frontend and backend services. It is a lightweight, end to end type safe, that makes it easy to rapidly build app and break nothing.

# NextAuth.js

For authentication and authorization, I rely on NextAuth.js, a library that provides an easy way to add secure authentication and authorization to Next.js applications. It supports a variety of authentication providers such as Google, Facebook, and GitHub, and also allows me to use my own custom authentication logic.

# Prisma

Finally, I use Prisma as my data access layer. It is a modern, open-source data layer that provides a flexible and powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for many database. It integrates seamlessly with TypeScript and allows me to write clean, maintainable code for interacting with my database.

# Conclusion

Overall, this stack has proven to be a great combination for me and has helped me build efficient, scalable, and maintainable web applications. I highly recommend giving it a try if you are looking to build modern, full-stack JavaScript applications.
